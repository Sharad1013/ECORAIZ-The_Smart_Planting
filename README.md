# EcoRaiz : Smart Planting System 🌿

**EcoRaiz** is an intelligent planting system designed to help transform dry, barren land into thriving green forests. The system uses advanced image processing and environmental analysis to determine the best areas and plant species for cultivation.

## 🌱 How It Works

1. **Upload Plot Image**
   The user begins by uploading a top-view photo of the land or plot.

2. **Automatic Division**
   🌳 EcoRaiz automatically divides the uploaded image into smaller sub-plots for detailed analysis.🌿

3. **Input Environmental Data**
   For each sub-plot, the user enters key environmental parameters:

   * Temperature
   * Humidity
   * Soil pH
   * Soil Moisture

4. **Analysis and Ranking**
   Based on the input data, the system analyzes each sub-plot and:

   * Determines which areas are currently suitable for planting.
   * Suggests the most suitable tree species for each sub-plot, prioritizing trees with a minimum lifespan of 20 to 50 years.

5. **Visual Output**
   The system generates a visual ranking overlay on the divided plot image, highlighting the best zones for planting and the recommended tree types.
