# 🌿 EcoRaiz: The Smart Planting System

**EcoRaiz** is an intelligent planting system designed to help transform dry, barren land into thriving green forests. By combining image processing and environmental analysis, it identifies the best zones for planting and recommends tree species based on sustainability, soil condition, and climate.

---

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Upload Land Image**  
   User uploads a top-view image of the plot.

2. **Automatic Plot Division**  
   EcoRaiz divides the image into smaller sub-plots for detailed analysis.

3. **Environmental Data Input**  
   For each sub-plot, the user provides:
   - 🌡️ Temperature  
   - 💧 Humidity  
   - ⚗️ Soil pH  
   - 🌱 Soil Moisture  

4. **Analysis & Tree Suggestion**  
   The system:
   - Analyzes sub-plots
   - Ranks suitable planting zones
   - Suggests long-lifespan trees (20–50+ years)

5. **Visual Output**  
   Outputs a visually ranked overlay on the plot with planting suggestions.
